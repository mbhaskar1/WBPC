1. Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number, `a`.
```
Sample Output:
Input a number: 6                                                       
6 x 1 = 6                                                               
6 x 2 = 12                                                              
6 x 3 = 18                                                              
6 x 4 = 24                                                              
6 x 5 = 30                                                              
6 x 6 = 36                                                              
6 x 7 = 42                                                              
6 x 8 = 48                                                              
6 x 9 = 54                                                              
6 x 10 = 60 
```
2. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between `a` and `b` (both included). Both `a` and `b` are integers greater than 0.
3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three `print("Fizz")` instead of the number and for the multiples of five `print("Buzz")`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five `print("FizzBuzz")`.
```
Sample Output:
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
```
4. Given an integer greater than 0, `n`, write a Python program to construct the following pattern where `n` is the length of the longest row.
```
Sample Output:
Input a number: 5 
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```
